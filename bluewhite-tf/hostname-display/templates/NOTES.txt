1. Get the application URL by running this command:

   kubectl get ingress -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

   NOTE: It may take a few minutes for the Ingress resource to acquire the external IP address. You can monitor the status using the above command.

2. Once the external IP address is available, access your application using the following URL:

   http://<external-ip>
